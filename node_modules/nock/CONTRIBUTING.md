### Commit Message conventions

`nock` releases are automated using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
To automatically calculate the correct version number as well as changelogs,
three commit message conventions need to be followed

- Commit bug fixes with `fix: ...` or `fix(scope): ...` prefix in commit subject
- Commit new features with `feat: ...` or `feat(scope): ...` prefix in commit subject
- Commit breaking changes by adding `BREAKING CHANGE: ` in the commit body
  (not the subject line)

Other helpful conventions are

- Commit test files with `test: ...` or `test(scope): ...` prefix
- Commit changes to `package.json`, `.gitignore` and other meta files with
  `chore(filename-without-ext): ...`
- Commit changes to README files or comments with `docs: ...`
- Code style changes with `style: standard`

The commit message(s) of a pull request can be fixed using the `squash & merge` button.

### Generate README TOC

Make sure to update the README's table of contents whenever you update the README using the following npm script.

```
$ npm run toc
```

### Running tests

```
$ npm test
```

#### Airplane mode

Some of the tests depend on online connectivity. To skip them, set the `AIRPLANE` environment variable to some value.

```
$ export AIRPLANE=true
$ npm test
```
