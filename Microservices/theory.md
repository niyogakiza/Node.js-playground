## Basic principles of Microservices
##### - One microservice should only do one task, like fetching a customer from a backend.
##### - It should be possible to develop and deploy a microservice completely independent from all other parts of an application.
##### - Microservice should communicate using standard HTTP methods.
## Benefits of Using Microservices
##### - New developers don't have to understand the whole application
##### - Services can be developed and deployed by independent teams
##### - Services can be developed with languages that does a given task best.
##### - If a service fails, not the whole application has to fail.
